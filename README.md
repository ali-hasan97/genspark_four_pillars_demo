# genspark_four_pillars_demo
Demonstrates four pillars of OOP

Look into Main.java to see implementation of the four pillars of OOP. It is commented with each pillar that it demonstrates. Other classes also contain helpful comments.

Some sections of the code demonstrate more than one pillar, but I wanted to have an independent example for each pillar so some pillars are demonstrated multiple times.
